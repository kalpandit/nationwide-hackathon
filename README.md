# nationwide-hackathon

Code for Rutgers CSDN's submission to the Nationwide Hackathon

Includes code for our scavenger application as well as code for an acceleration scrapper.

NOTE: To enable location tracking and speed limit detection, go to LimitsView.js and uncomment the labeled portion. You'll need a speed limit API that supports JSON (from Bing, Google Maps or someplace else) to fit it to your use case.

How to start:
1. Set up Expo CLI: npm install -g expo-cli
2. Clone this repository and start an Expo instance: expo start
3. Scan the QR code from the terminal (iOS) or use the Expo Go app on Android to run on your device
